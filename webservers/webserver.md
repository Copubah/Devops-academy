## Introduction to Webservers and Hosting basics
- Webservers are software applications that serve web content to users in response to their request over the internet
## Role of Webservers
- Content Delivery: they are responsible for delivering web pages, images, files, and other resources to users' web browsers upon request. They store and manage these resources and serve them in response to HTTP requests from clients.

- Request Handling: they handle incoming HTTP requests from clients, such as web browsers or mobile devices.

- Protocol Support: support the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), the primary protocol used for communication between web clients and servers. 

- Security: they play a crucial role in ensuring the security of web applications and data. They enforce access control mechanisms, authenticate users, and encrypt data transmissions using protocols like HTTPS (HTTP Secure). 

- Configuration and Customization: Web servers are highly configurable, allowing administrators to tailor their settings and behavior to suit specific requirements. 

- Logging and Monitoring: Web servers generate logs that record details of incoming requests, server errors, and access statistics. 

- Scalability and Load Balancing: Web servers support scalability and load balancing mechanisms to handle increasing levels of traffic and distribute workload across multiple server instances.
